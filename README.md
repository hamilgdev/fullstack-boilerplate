# Fullstack Boilerplate

A boilerplate for fullstack applications with **NextJS**, **NestJS** and, **PostgreSQL**.

## 📜 System Requirement

- Node.js `20.10.0` or later [👉 Install Node](https://nodejs.org/es/download)
- NPM [👉 Install npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- Nextjs `14.0.4` or later [👉 Install Next](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)
- Nestjs `10.0.0` or later [👉 Install Nest](https://docs.nestjs.com/)
- GNU Make `3.81` or later [👉 Install Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Visual Studio Code

Extensions aditionals

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint): It helps you see the alerts from the linter in real-time in your editor.

## 🗃️ Environment

You can use the `.env.template` file to create your `.env` file. This file is used to set the environment variables.

## 📚 Folder Structure

- `frontend/`: Source code base. Frontend made with **NextJS**
- `backend/`: Source code base. Backend made with **NestJS**
- `provision/`: The files to provision the Docker containers
- `Makefile`: The file to run the commands to initialize, execute and more the application

## 🛠️ Setting implementation

1. Create a new repository using this template
2. (optional) Rename the `image`, `container_name` and `networks` in the `docker-compose.yml` file according to your project
   - Make sure that the new name matches with the **Makefile** instructions in the root `/` of the project
3. (optional) Rename the `name` in the `package.json` of the **frontend** and **backend** file according to your project
4. Determine the **environment variables** in the `.env` file. According to the `.env.template` initial file defined in the root `/` of the project
5. Using the **Makefile** of the root `/` of the project, run the following command to initialize installing the dependencies of **frontend** and **backend** the application:

    - ```bash
      make app.init_dev
      ```

6. Initialize the `@prisma/client` with the following command:

    - ```bash
      make prisma.generate
      ```

Build the containers. Go to the next section [🐳 Running the app inside containers](#-running-the-app-inside-containers)

## 🐳 Running the app inside containers

To run the application with containers you will need:

- Docker. [👉 Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose. [👉 Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

then run the following command int the root `/` to initialize the application:

Build the containers

```bash
  make app.build_dev
```

Run the containers

```bash
  make app.start_dev
```

Or you can run the **frontend** container with one command

```bash
  make frontend.start_dev
```

Or you can run the **backend** container with one command

```bash
  make backend.start_dev
```

Also you can run the **database** container with one command

```bash
  make database.start_dev
```

## 🚀 Running the implementation

When the application is running, usging the default configuration

you can access the **frontend** in the following url:

- [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

you can access the **backend** in the following url:

- [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

and, you can access the swagger documentation of the **backend** in the following url:

- [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api)
